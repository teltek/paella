Inside this directory, you'll find a specific directory for the Paella Player, containing the compiled player and some examples.


## Test Paella

To test Paella you need to put the files you downloaded in a web server. You can *not* open the index.html file from
a local folder.

If you don't have a web server to test you ned to download one ([nginx](https://nginx.org/),
[apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), ...) or you can create one easyly with python.

Run this command from the paella folder and navigate to http://localhost:8000
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
